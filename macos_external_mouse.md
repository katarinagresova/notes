# Controlling macbook with third party mouse

Macbook trackpad is one of the best thinks on macbook laptop. 
But since I am moving to mouse-keybord-monitor setup (for ergonomic reasons), I am loosing this feature.
I got non-Apple ergonomic mouse that is great, but soon I realized that I am not able to properly control my macbook.
I couldn't find a way how to switch between desktop spaces without using trackpad.
I so googled and as I expected, there is a way how to map those gestures to any mouse (not just apple mouse).
Resources I followed to set it up:
- [How to use a third-party mouse on Mac and get trackpad gestures (article)](https://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-use-third-party-mouse-on-mac/)
- [macOS Multi-touch Mouse Gestures on Third Party Mouse (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N9O6asWTZY&ab_channel=ProductivityCareer)
